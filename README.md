# Welcome to my Unity Game (For Android)

This was a project made only by 2 developers, learning Interaction Design.

The project was made in Unity with a Vuforia SDK to use Augmented Reality and then compiled to an APK.

I do not own most of the content used in this project like: 
* Music/Sounds
* Assets
* Public code used (Mostly imports). 

I do not earn money from this and the only purpose of it was to complete the corresponding course.

## History of the game
The point of the game is to play the multiple mini games available in this one app. There is the basketball game, the shooting game and the puzzle game. Each of this game unique rules and gameplay modes. 

## How to play
Choose the game you are willing to play in the main menu and then read the instructions inside of each of the minigames.

## Compatibility 
This game was developed to run in Android with AR features. It won't work on Apple devices or old android devices. 

## Credit
You have all rights to use it as you wish, but I will be so grateful if you credit me for my work. Have fun!
